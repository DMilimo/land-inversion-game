## About:

<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/TWScYU9.png" width = 100% height = 100%>


This is a Platformer/Shooter video game, made in Python. The engine is able to handle a lot of tasks including: 

* Displaying sprites and updating them.
* Supporting multiple game resolutions.
* Enabling or disabling certain features (effects).Displaying an interactive parallax background.
* Displaying different animations (idle, moving, jumping...).
* Playing sounds and music.
* Scoring Enermies killed during the game.
* Displaying interactive Buttons that can be linked to different actions.
* Displaying a User Interface (Health, Ammunition, Level Timer and other stuff).
* Displaying interactive enemies and updating them (they can shoot, be shot at and patrol).
* Displaying particles & different effects (explosion, shooting and jumping).
* Handling level transitions and level restarts.
* Editing levels using a custom integrated level editor (levels can be saved and played instantly).
* And a few more minor features...

This project is no longer in-development. But that doesn't mean it won't receive some updates.
